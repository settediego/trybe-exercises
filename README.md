Hi, I'm Diego Sette, student at Trybe.

This repository is the place where I'll put all the lessons content during the Full Stack Web Developer Course.

It includes all the exercises that I've been doing and some notes that I take watching the videos and lessons.

All content here will be organized by module, session and class day.

Enjoy!
